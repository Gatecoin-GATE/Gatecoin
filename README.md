# Gatecoin
===========================================

What is Gatecoin ?
----------------------

Gatecoin is a coin based on Blake-256 POW algorithm, including VRX ( difficulty changes for every block, 51% attacks and time warp attacks ). For full details, please visit our website at https://gatecoin-gate.github.io . Compiled binary releases are available on Github.

# Characteristics
-------------------

Hash Algorithm : Blake-256 POW algorithm ( GPU/FPGA/ASIC )
( With the addition of modified VRX algorithm, that changes difficulty every block, and prevent 51% atack !!)

Total Supply : 10,000,000 GATE

Difficulty adjusted every block and possibly in CURRENT block if a long network stale tip happens !! This protects Gatecoin from high hash variations and " high hash attacks " , that happens frequently for new coins and kills them by making the mining difficulty too high for the " normal " network's hash rate.

10 minutes block time.

Premine : 100,000 coins, 1 % of max supply

Block Reward : 50 Gatecoin - halved every 105,120 blocks ( 2 years )
