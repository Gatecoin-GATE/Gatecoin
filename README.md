Forked from Blakecoin reference wallet 0.8.6(last)

Blake-256(optimized) is faster than Scrypt, SHA-256D, Keccak, Groestl
The algorithm was written as a candidate for sha3, Based on round one 
candidate code from the sphlib 2.1 and reduced rounds to 8.

What is Gatecoin?

Gatecoin is a coin made by miner for miners. It is a currency
created with the objective of being mined and providing miners.

# Characteristics
Hash Algorithm : Blake-256 POW algorithm ( GPU/FPGA/ASIC )
( With the addition of modified VRX algorithm, that changes difficulty every block, and prevent 51% atack !!)

Total Supply : 10,000,000 GATE

Difficulty adjusted every block and possibly in CURRENT block if a long network stale tip happens !! This protects Gatecoin from high hash variations and " high hash attacks " , that happens frequently for new coins and kills them by making the mining difficulty too high for the " normal " network's hash rate.

10 minutes block time.

Number of confirmations needed for a transaction : 6 (transaction is confirmed in approximately 30 seconds)

Premine : 100,000 coins, barely above 1 % of max supply

Block Reward : 50 Gatecoin - halved every 1 051 200 blocks
